"Tonight I proved I can operate on a Joy-Con controller successfully. You need three hands, bright light, and a magnifier. I had two hands and insufficient light for my 54-year-old eyes. Between that and an IFixit tutorial, I replaced a joystick and changed to all-white buttons." <L>0</L>
"It seems to have started when I replaced the screen, but there wasn‚Äôt anything in the iFixit guide about preventing vampirism üò≠"  <L>0</L>
@techmonk420 @iFixit @FrameworkPuter @Fairphone looks dope. i ALL for upcycling and re-working tech into my life. <L>0</L>
@iFixit I'm on my beloved 2015 MacBook Pro thanks to you folks helping me resurrect my favorite rig! I can't thank you enough! <L>+</L>
"@Discreet_user_ I'm not sure if they exist in Australia though I believe they might. It's a company called iFixit. They're big on ""right to repair"" and usually have complete walkthroughs on how to fix stuff. Might even be same to take it to a shop if they got one near you." <L>+</L>
@lipilipsi @MaxWinebach @waxeditorial @domenicopanacea That's actually an edited image of mine. I used Photoshop to write A17 Bionic on the die. The logic board image is from iFixit üòÜ
"@CFC_Jak @KROOO82767777 @ShitpostGate That's what I said, but yeah bought myself an ifixit kit and it's no longer an issue" <L>+</L>
"Today I have replaced both of my Joysticks with new ones for my PS Vita with the help of iFixit Essential 
Electronics Toolkit and its Magnetic Project Mat! https://t.co/DNSTzMTnB5" <L>+</L>
@techmonk420 @FrameworkPuter @iFixit @Fairphone I'm so disappointed of my FP4 üòê...  <L>0</L>
"Surgery complete. Magnetic joysticks from  GuliKit, buttons from ExtremeRate, plus tools and manuals from iFixit. I wish the buttons were a better color match to the Joycons, but it is uniquely mine, now. https://t.co/1s6dP66lTC" <L>+</L>
"@thearcadio_ @bestpersonevaar @Wario64 A screen protector is $20 max, an SSD drive $120 or so. Savings almost $200. Screen isn't worth $200 in fact it's only $100 on ifixit and I ended up upgrading my storage anyway. You seem to have a niche use case for the screen. Just giving OP options." <L>0</L>
"@kazoodac hey, remember that Switch Pro Controller forum post you made back in 2018 on iFixit?
I was also trying to replace the drifting joysticks, and ran into the same issue where the stick does not reach the edge in the calibration menu and investigated the reason why." <L>0</L>
@jJQackiee @PaulGag03426073 @elonmusk All Cars (and Computers) should be repairable by the Owner and by Independent Repair Shops. I like iFixit.  <L>+</L>

@LinusTech @iFixit I asked Logitech if they can repair it at a cost; they can't. Then I tried to see if I can find a replacement circuit; there aren't any (unless I buy a used full system). I asked Logitech if I can somehow buy a circuit; they don't sell. They expect me to just throw it away. <L>0</L>
@kwiens  - what‚Äôs going on with ifixit customer services Karl? 37% of your customers are giving you lowest possible rating. I‚Äôve been trying to resolve an issue with a delivery of one of your toolkits for over a month now! https://t.co/4x3FWyAJQ7 <L>0</L>
"I can relate to this

Also, @iFixit Tools along with Step by Step Guides for the win!" <L>+</L>
"@ElektroBlades I have the 256GB and still felt like I didn‚Äôt have enough storage until I upgraded. So I‚Äôd either get the 512GB, or buy a fast micro SD card to expand (which works great in my experience). You can also swap the SSD pretty easily; I know iFixit sells kits to do so." <L>0</L>
"@foxfortmobile It happened to me 2 years and a half ago. It does not had warranty so I but an entire logic on eBay to solve it around $180. At that moment, I bought a battery replacement on iFixit. I personally changed everything. I think u have to considerate if is it worth." <L>+</L>
Xbox overheated so I opened it to see if I could fix by dislodging dust or unwinding one of gf‚Äôs long hairs. Hit it spinning again but it‚Äôs now audible. Hopefully good for the night. New fan coming today. Ifixit tools and directions https://t.co/fCpS5GITDe <L>0</L>
