I actually donâ€™t even know if openAI folks would disagree. Selling to established enterprises is a different beast than startups (esp in regulated sectors). Why not stay super focused on startups w cutting edge use cases and let Microsoft handle the boomers? Seems like a win win <L>-</L>
Shoutout to Xbox for earning me these very random Microsoft points I have no idea how or why to redeem <L>+</L>

"@TakeThatNurses I once had a security guard tell me that only head-in parking was allowed.

Mind you that was at Xerox where the techies invented what became MacOS and Microsoft Windows but the management was famous for focusing on all the wrong things." <L>+</L>
"@Holeyfield85 I hope that it ends up being good for a few of those developers.  If Microsoft ups Bethesda's writing budget from the apparent $30 it's been at, they could create something crazy." <L>+</L>
@PejvakD @Microsoft 1000% agree!  I still have 2 of these and love them. <L>+</L>
@thurrott @Microsoft Interesting.  Your screen shot is the first time I've ever seen this.  But I also haven't seen it on my M365 Family edition that is 100% disconnected from my corp account. Internet says it has been an issue since 2022 though.  Weird. <L>-</L>
"@_thefinegirl I flipped through the back of my dad's huge Webster's Dictionary (might have been an encyclopaedia), it had photos of the American presidents, and probably landmarks around the world, and a bunch more

And Microsoft Encarta was bae before women started stealing my heart" <L>+</L>
I hate both Sony and Microsoft buying up or attempting to buy these developers.  I don't give a damn about CoD but this definitely could expand to other games especially if the deal falls through. <L>-</L>
"@wynhopkins Haahahha, very simplistic!! Excel is the only reason I know what that word means, was never in my vocabulary ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€" <L>+</L>
"Bing, Microsoft, Google, Notion, Adobe, various UX startups (?) who else am I missing" <L>0</L>
"I miss my PC actually working bro I wanna work in a real DAW instead of fuckin garage band on my phone, you will rue this day @Microsoft" <L>-</L>
@itsmarcosruiz Bro I had to take intro to information systemsâ€¦. It teaches you how to use Microsoft wordâ€¦. <L>0</L>
"@Microsoft I really wonder. Am I the only one who thinks that you should combine the ""Search"" section of the taskbar with the ""Start"" button? And also need groups. Like ""Games"", ""Work"", ""Blabla"". Come on please." <L>-</L>
@NextGenPlayer I mean then 10 years should be enough for Microsoft to make their own fps since thatâ€™s the whole point of buying ABK  <L>0</L>

"@film_girl @dpreview That was one of the first sites I used when they first came out, dinosaur years ago. I remember surfing there from my desk at Microsoft thinking ""this is a game changer"" "<L>0</L>
@M00CHTV I knew Microsoft was going to make COD exclusive at some point <L>-</L>
@susiesimsie I haven't because my IRL job's IT manager said 11 is trash and Microsoft will support 10 for a few more years! <L>-</L>
