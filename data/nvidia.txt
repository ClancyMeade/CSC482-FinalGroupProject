@IrishVhure @mawntee And actually.. How is even any of that any related to mawntee's case... I am 99.99% sure he's rocking intel lmao. Nvidia problems you mentioned were fixed ages ago and they keep releasing patches with AMD fixing up things.  <L>+</L>
"@JeTmAn1981 @Dell @MichaelDell Then it's the Intel Arc A750 with 8GB of VRAM, for $250 (these are new cards, very good for the money).
